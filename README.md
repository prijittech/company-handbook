## Configuring the environment

This guide will show how to set up a standard, secure environment for software development.


## 1. Create an encrypted volume (host machine)
Due to the variety of operating systems used by our team, we do not impose a specific solution. It depends on what software you use. For Linux systems it can be LUKS. For MacOS you can use built-in FileVault encryption.

Due to the large space utilization of our projects, the minimum partition size is 50 GB (recommended size: 100 GB).

In case you have no preferences, we recommend using [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html).
